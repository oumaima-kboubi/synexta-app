## About this project ü§î
This Symfony project is part of a technical test. 
The goal is to develop a web application with two main parts. In the first part, users can create an account, providing their name, email (unique), and a 12-character password. Upon registration, a unique account validation link is sent to the user's email. Users can log in, log out, and edit their name and surname after logging in.

In the second part, there is a shared database table containing a minimum of 10 products and 3 product categories ( i generated the data using fixtures and faker bundle). When logged in, users can add individual products to their personal list, add entire product categories to the list, remove products from their list, save their product choices and filter the products based on their categories. These choices persist across sessions. Products can be associated with multiple users, and each user has their personalized product list. ü•≥

It uses the **monorepo** strategy ‚úÖ:    

1- ‚ö° **/templates**: The frontend templates that will be exposed to the users.   
2- ‚ö° **/src**: The backend part where all the functionnalities' logic goes.   
3- ‚ö° **/README FILE imgs**: This folder contains the DB SQL dump file and the images for this fantastic README file. ü•≥  
3- ‚ö° **/docker-compose.yml**: The fake mailer server config on docker.
